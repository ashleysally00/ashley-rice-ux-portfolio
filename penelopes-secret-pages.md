### My Role
I wrote the poems and designed the structure and copy for this section of the author website.  
I organized the hidden poetry pages into a cohesive hub, added internal navigation for discoverability, and aligned tone, visuals, and layout with the Penelope J. Miller book series.  
I also optimized titles and internal links for search visibility and Pinterest engagement.
