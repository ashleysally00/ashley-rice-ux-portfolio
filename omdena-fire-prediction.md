## Objective
Part of Omdena’s AI-Powered Forest Fire Prediction and Early Warning System for Uttarakhand, India.  
This work focused on improving how collaborators used and understood a multi-tool data workflow spanning GEE, Colab, and DagsHub.

## UX Contributions

### Onboarding Experience Design
Created contributor onboarding that went beyond setup instructions.  
The workflow was broken into clear, progressive steps (GEE → Colab → Cloud → DagsHub), applying information architecture to guide users through complex tools.

### User Flow Simplification
Turned a technical, satellite-data workflow into a usable, repeatable process.  
Guides were structured to reduce cognitive load for new collaborators — a core UX principle.

### Accessibility & Clarity
Added screenshots, glossary entries, and consistent formatting to make the workflow accessible for users with a range of technical backgrounds — from global volunteers and data scientists to wildfire professionals.

### Research-Driven Design
Planned and conducted an interview with a California wildfire Public Information Officer to understand how satellite data supports emergency response.  
Developed the questions, led the interview, and summarized insights into actionable design guidance for the project.  
The interview was later written and published as an article across multiple platforms to extend accessibility and relevance for the wider research and emergency response community.

### Error Handling & Task Feedback
Documented troubleshooting for recurring GEE errors, including the “Too Many Tasks” issue.  
Designed clear task monitoring steps to help users recognize progress, recover from errors, and maintain workflow continuity.

### Cross-Platform Usability
Outlined the path between GEE, Colab, and DagsHub to create a unified experience for contributors.  
This documentation improved interoperability and reduced friction across platforms.

## Reflection
This project, I applied UX design thinking to scientific collaboration.  
By treating documentation and workflows as part of the user experience, the project improved clarity, accessibility, and confidence for contributors working in a technically complex environment.
