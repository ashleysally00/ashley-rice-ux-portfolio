# Omdena Fire Prediction Project (Uttarakhand)

**Role:** UX Contributor – Workflow Design & Research  
**Platform:** Google Earth Engine (GEE), Google Colab, DagsHub  
**Project Type:** AI for Social Good • Data Tool UX • Contributor Experience Design  

---

## Objective
Part of Omdena’s AI-Powered Forest Fire Prediction and Early Warning System for Uttarakhand, India.  
This work focused on improving how collaborators used and understood a multi-tool data workflow spanning GEE, Colab, and DagsHub.

## UX Contributions

### Onboarding Experience Design
Created contributor onboarding that went beyond setup instructions.  
The workflow was broken into clear, progressive steps (GEE → Colab → Cloud → DagsHub), applying information architecture to guide users through complex tools.

### User Flow Simplification
Turned a technical, satellite-data workflow into a usable, repeatable process.  
Guides were structured to reduce cognitive load for new collaborators — a core UX principle.

### Accessibility & Clarity
Added screenshots, glossary entries, and consistent formatting to make the workflow accessible for users with a range of technical backgrounds — from global volunteers and data scientists to wildfire professionals.

### Research-Driven Design
Planned and conducted an interview with a California wildfire Public Information Officer to understand how satellite data supports emergency response.  
Developed the questions, led the interview, and summarized insights into actionable design guidance for the project.  
The interview was later written and published as an article across multiple platforms to extend accessibility and relevance for the wider research and emergency response community.

### Error Handling & Task Feedback
Documented troubleshooting for recurring GEE errors, including the “Too Many Tasks” issue. 
Designed clear task monitoring steps to help users recognize progress, recover from errors, and maintain workflow continuity.

### Collaboration Example — Troubleshooting and Iteration
- Helped contributors in Slack resolve a recurring **“Too Many Tasks”** error in Google Earth Engine, which appeared when users tried to export too much satellite data at once.  
- Identified that the issue came from exceeding GEE’s 3,000-task queue limit during large batch exports.  
- Tested and documented a clearer fix: filtering data by year, exporting one year at a time, and adding a **task-monitoring loop** to prevent queue overload.  
- Updated onboarding documentation and added screenshots explaining the step-by-step process in Google Colab.  
- **Outcome:** Fewer failed runs, faster onboarding for new contributors, and reusable guidance for future satellite data workflows.  

### Reflection
We were able to work better as a team because we shared our workflow and documentation.  
By helping each other in Slack and keeping the process clear, it became easier for everyone to understand what to do and move forward without getting stuck.
