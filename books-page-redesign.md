# Books Page Redesign — Structured Captions and Consistent Layout

**Role:** UX Content Designer · Information Architect · Copywriter  
**Platform:** ashleyrice.net (Squarespace 7.1)  
**Project Type:** Live Author Website Optimization  

---

## Objective
Redesign the Books page to align all book covers consistently while preserving accessibility, SEO structure, and a clean visual grid.  
The challenge: Squarespace galleries did not allow uniform caption text or proper heading hierarchy, which hurt both usability and search clarity.

---

## Process and Contributions

**Problem Discovery**  
Identified misaligned book covers, inconsistent padding, and duplicate SEO headings flagged by SEMrush.  
Analyzed Squarespace 7.1 gallery behavior and confirmed that captions collapsed the heading structure (H1–H3), affecting crawlability.

**Information Architecture and Technical Approach**  
- Converted the book list to a gallery with a fixed 2:3 aspect ratio for consistent image sizing
